## **\*Q: What is the time complexity of searching for an element in a binary search tree?**

The time complexity of searching for an element in a **binary search tree (BST)** depends on the tree’s structure.

- **Best Case (Balanced BST)**: O(log n) because you’re essentially cutting the search space in half at each step—like in binary search.
- **Worst Case (Unbalanced BST)**: O(n), such as in a skewed tree where all the nodes are in a straight line, requiring traversal through every node to find the desired element.

So, the efficiency really depends on how balanced the tree is.




## **\*Q: What is the difference between depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS)?**

The main difference between **depth-first search (DFS)** and **breadth-first search (BFS)** is the way they explore a graph or tree.

- **DFS**:
  - Goes deep first—it picks a path and keeps going down until it hits a dead end, then backtracks and tries another path.
  - Uses a **stack** (or recursion) to keep track of the traversal path.
  - Good for problems where you need to find a path or explore all possibilities.

- **BFS**:
  - Explores level by level. It starts at the root, checks all the neighbors, then moves to the next layer of nodes.
  - Uses a ## **Queue** to manage the traversal order.
  - Better for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

DFS is like diving straight into a maze and only turning back when you hit a wall, while BFS is like systematically searching a maze one step at a time, ensuring you cover everything at the current level before moving deeper.
