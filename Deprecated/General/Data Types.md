# Unsigned Integer Type
These types are used to store whole numbers.
### int
Typically a 32-bit signed integer on most systems.<br>
Range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
```
int x = 32;
```
### short
A smaller integer usually 16 bits.<br>
Range: -32,768 to 32,767
### long
A larger integer usually 32 or 64 bits.<br>
Range (32 bit): -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647<br>
Range (64 bit): -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
### long long
An even larger 64-bit integer longer than a long.<br>
Range: -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807

# Signed Integer Type
### unsigned int
Non-negative integers.<br>
Range: 0 to 4,294,967,295.
### unsigned short
Non-negative smaller integers.<br>
Range: 0 to 65,535.
### unsigned long
Non-negative larger integers.
Range (32 bit): 0 to 4,294,967,295<br>
Range (64 bit): 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615
### unsigned long long
Non-negative longer integers.<br>
Range: 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615.

# Floating Point Types
These are used to store numbers with decimal points.
### float
Single precision floating-point number (usually 32 bits).<br>
Range: Approximately ±3.4E-38 to ±3.4E+38 with 6 decimal digits of precision.
### double
Double precision floating-point number (usually 64 bits).<br>
Range: Approximately ±1.7E-308 to ±1.7E+308 with 15 decimal digits of precision.
### long double
Extended precision floating-point number (often 80 or 128 bits).<br>
Range: Similar to double, but with extended precision.
