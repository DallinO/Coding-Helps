## **\*Q: Can you explain the difference between an array and a linked list?**

The main difference between an **array** and a **linked list** is how they store and manage data.

- **Array**:
  - A collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.
  - Allows for fast access because you can jump directly to any element using its index.
  - Has a fixed size, so if you need more space, you might have to create a new array and copy everything over.
  
- **Linked List**:
  - Made up of nodes, where each node contains the data and a pointer to the next node.
  - More flexibleâ€”you can easily add or remove elements without worrying about shifting data around.
  - Accessing elements is slower because you have to start at the head and traverse through the list to find what you need.

So, arrays are better for random access, while linked lists are better for dynamic memory management and frequent insertions or deletions.
